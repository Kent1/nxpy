What is nxpy?

nxpy is actually a device-xml-configuration to python mapper or proxy if you like. nxpy maps device xml configuration to python classes.

!!! IMPORTANT !!! 
For the time, it is compatible *ONLY* with Junipers' xml configuration. In the future it will be expanded to support a wider variety of vendors.

What can I do with nxpy?

nxpy allows for retrieving the device configuration in xml format (using either netconf or "show configuration | display xml" 
via an excpect script), transform the configuration to python classes and manipulate the classes (view, edit, delete).
After editing, the configuration can be applied back to the device via netconf or cli expect.
Furthermore, it allows for building configuration via python classes, and apply it to the device(s) via netconf or cli expect.
For the time, it supports limited configuration changes. As time goes by, I'll enhance it with many many more configuration parts.

Give me some examples...
1. Grab the configuration in xml format
Let's say that you have grabbed your Juniper device configuration in xml format (This is STRICT!!!). You can use either
"show configuration | display xml" (and copy paste the output to a file), or use an automated cli excpect script or invoke netconf.
Since all is Python, I would go for the ncclient (http://schmizz.net/ncclient/), or my modified ncclient that Junipers like (branch dev-junos)
(https://github.com/leopoul/ncclient/tree/dev_junos).

2. Feed the configuration to nxpy

import nxpy as np
conf = np.Parser(<configuration_file_OR_configuration_text>)
conf = conf.export()

To check whether you have grabbed the configuration just give:

conf.interfaces

(...you should get the list of device interfaces)


Changelog:

v0.3:
- Support for basic interface configuration (name, description, vlan)
- Support for basic vlan configuration

v0.4:
- Added full support for bgp flowspec (routing-options flow) configuration
